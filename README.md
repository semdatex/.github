# templates-default

## What is this?

A template repository for all SEMDATEX repositories. There may be more specific templates for certain types of
repositories, but this is the default template for all repositories, including other templates.

## Why do we need a default template repository?

- As a team we should have a way to converge our newest best practices. This repository template allows us to make sure
that all new repositories are created with the same basic configuration.
- Every new repository must containe a CODEOWNERS file that protects certain sensitive files from being edited without approval.

## How is this used?

When creating a new repository, you can select this repository as a template. This will create a new repository with
the same file as this repository, but with the name of the new repository. Just like a repository fork, but without
the history of this repository.

This readme is also replicated in all newly created repositories. Users are expected to edit this readme, but still keep
the same outline structure that addresses the What, Why and How questions.
